# full-stack-todo-list
  Simple web service that allows users to create and modify TODO lists. I've used React for front end and java spring for RESTapi. REST service uses database with two related tables users and tasks. which are related by user_id.
  App doesn't have registration form so you have to insert users manually to the database table.
